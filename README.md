# Description
This C++ OOP project is a console application that allows users to purchase tickets for various events.
The application utilizes object-oriented programming principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to create a flexible and scalable design.


The application allows users to select an event and choose from available seating options. Users can either:
- purchase tickets with unique ids, validate their tickets, and modify an owned ticket's status;

- see a location's layout, manage locations, see their events, and add events to specific locations.
